# DRRT-Regeneration-Inhibitor
This mod is made for the Debris Regional Reassembly Tournament series.

**EXTREMELY SIMPLE MOD** that changes a single cvar:

`kSlowGrowRate = 0.2`

This cvar makes BLOCKS regenerate at one fifth (20%) of the rate at which they do in Tournament mode.
Shield regeneration is unaffected.

This mod was made to look more official than a "simple cvar mod" so that participants could more easily find it.

This mod was created to test the idea that decreasing the overall regeneration rate will make damage more meaningful. I believe that this is a good idea for DRRTs.
